# Test Files
This directory contains test cases which are part of version control. These are used by `integration_tests.py`.

The `gen` directory also contains test cases which are part of version control, but these files are programmatically generated by `generate_testcases.py`. Specifically, they are created by running `python generate_testcases.py` while in the `gen` directory.
